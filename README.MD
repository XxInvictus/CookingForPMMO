Cooking For PMMO  
Don't expect anything fancy here, this is a simple compat to receive PMMO XP from the Cooking For Blockheads oven.  
  
Requirements:  
- PMMO (>1.16.5-3.67.7)
- Cooking For Blockheads (9.3.4)  
  
WARNING: As this mod gets the cooking XP values from the RESULT not from the Ingredients like PMMO currently does you will need XP values for the cooked items in your config. This brings it more in-line with things like the Crafting XP where you get XP based on what you make not what you used to make it.
